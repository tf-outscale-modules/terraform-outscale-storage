# Product Mission

## Problem

Managing cloud storage resources on Outscale is complex and error-prone without standardized Terraform modules. Teams waste time writing ad-hoc configurations, leading to inconsistent infrastructure, security gaps, and operational overhead.

## Target Users

Both DevOps/platform teams and application developers working with Outscale cloud who need to provision and manage storage resources reliably.

## Solution

Opinionated, well-tested Terraform modules that enforce best practices for Outscale storage. These standardized modules abstract away Outscale-specific complexity, ensuring consistent, secure, and repeatable storage provisioning across teams and projects.
